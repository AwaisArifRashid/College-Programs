# College-Programs
Greetings! This file may seem messy its essentially my way to figure out how to use GIT while ensuring the programs I work on during college gets saved across all the devices. The programs may not be that complicated however they are all coded by me (no ChatGPT here) this can be used as a way to check my programming progress. Thanks for reading :)
